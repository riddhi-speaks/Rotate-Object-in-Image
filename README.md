# Rotate-Object-in-Image

Description:

This project implements an advanced image manipulation technique combining object segmentation and 3D-like rotation. The core objective is to segment an object from an image based on a user-specified text prompt (e.g., "chair") and apply a user-defined rotation to the segmented object, while maintaining the original background scene.
This project tackles the challenge of editing object poses in product photographs using generative AI techniques. It aims to facilitate a user-friendly experience for post-production adjustments, enhancing product presentation on e-commerce websites.

Motivation:

Modern generative AI advancements enable innovative workflows, including post-production pose editing for product photos. This can significantly improve efficiency and offer greater creative control to businesses.

Tasks:

Object Segmentation: The initial step involves precisely segmenting the object based on a user-defined class prompt (e.g., "chair"). This segmentation allows for targeted pose editing.
Pose Adjustment: The user can then specify relative angles (azimuth, polar) to adjust the object's pose within the scene while preserving the background context.
