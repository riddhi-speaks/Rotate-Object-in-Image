# Rotate-Object-in-Image
This project implements an advanced image manipulation technique combining object segmentation and 3D-like rotation. The core objective is to segment an object from an image based on a user-specified text prompt (e.g., "chair") and apply a user-defined rotation to the segmented object, while maintaining the original background scene.
